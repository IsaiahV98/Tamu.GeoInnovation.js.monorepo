    <p>The Texas A&M Geoservices Geocoder can be used from desktop and/or web applications via the Geocoding Web Service interfaces listed below. The only required information is the API key, which is available in your account profile page. You may want to read the technical details and the known bugs.</p>

    <p>We currently provide geocoding for US addresses only.</p>

    <p>The following web services provide access to the Texas A&M Geoservices geocoding system. The versions below are the simplified APIs and offer reduced input parameters and output values than do the <a href="http://" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">advanced Geocoding APIs</a> which provide additional metadata about the internal working of the Texas A&M Geoservices Geocoder as well as advanced options for requesting specific computational options, reference data sources, output hierarchies, etc. (i.e., all the <a href="http://" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">science under the hood</a>).</p>

    <p>Most people probably don't need or care about the internal workings of geocoding systems, but they are provided in the advanced APIs in hopes that more people start to! If you are brave, <a href="http://" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">click here to view the advanced versions of the API's</a>.</p>
